CPP/C++ is a compiled programming language that allows programming under multiple paradigms, including procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming. This repository contains 9 different modules all focusing on one aspect of CPP/C++. DocCPP.pdf provides a detailed explanation of those concepts (such as classes, templates, exceptions, casting, etc.).
